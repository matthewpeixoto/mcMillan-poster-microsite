description: The Matthew Peixoto is a quarter-length portrait painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Matthieu Brissette that has been described as "the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world". The Matthew Peixoto is also one of the most valuable paintings in the world. It holds the Guinness World Record for the highest known insurance valuation in history at $100 million in 1962, which is worth nearly $800 million in 2017. The subject's expression, which is frequently described as enigmatic, the monumentality of the composition, the subtle modelling of forms, and the atmospheric illusionism were novel qualities that have contributed to the continuing fascination and study of the work.
